## Introducing CSS

CSS allows you to create rules to specify how content of an element should appear

### Style rules
- **Selectors**: indicate which element the rule applies to. Same rule can apply to more than 1 element (separate element names with comma)
- **Declarations**: indicate how elements are 'referred to' in the selecter should be styled. Split in to a property and a value separated by a colon

### Elements display
- **Properties**: Indicates aspects of the element you want to change. Example: color, font, width, height, etc.
- **Values**: Setting you want to choose with the properties

### Summary
- CSS treats HTML element as it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how the element shoud look
- Rules are made up of selectors and declarations
- Different types of selectors allow you to target rules at different elements
- Declarations are made up of 2 parts: properties and values
- Css rules are usually in a separate document, sometimes they appear in the HTML page
