## Learning Markdown
You've got a number of options when it comes to using markdown. Please see the information below to help guide you.

### Read

You can create bulleted lists!
* These are called **unordered**
* So you can list whatever you would like
* It's bullet heaven really..
* You can ~cross them off as you go~

You can also create **ordered** lists
1. These are numbered
1. And convey importance
1. Because they have numbers
1. **OoooooOOOOoooo**

### Watch

You also have an option to link cute dog videos.. or cat videos, like [this one](https://youtu.be/x92g01IsymM). Enjoy.

**Or** you could add an image, which I don't know how to do just yet. :grimacing:

### Just do it

Now your homework is to make a decision on what you think we should use in Markdown.

- [ ] unordered lists
- [ ] ordered lists
- [ ] a cool video
- [x] an image, you'll have to figure it out Angelica
