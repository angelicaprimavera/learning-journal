## Practice with git

[x] Clone down your learning journal

[x] Review your past entries and correctn any typos, fix any errors, bulk them up (if needed)

[x] Build out your site structure

[x] Keep a clean git history

### This is my additional page that I created to record my learnings.

## Additional notes
Created a library for reference

- Lab is link (only)
- Read is content + link

**Navigation (Raw Notes)**
- cd to file/ folder
- touch name.md (in terminal)
- code . = to open vs code
- After you are done typing
- git status
- git add . or git add FILE NAME
- git commit -m “added masterpiece”
- git push origin master
- Where are you ls or pwd

- Copy the link on clipboard (clone or download)
- After getting in to the folder
- git clone PASTE LINK
- touch index.html creates a new file
- live-server index.html
- control c (to end that mode)

- images/ (all options show up)
- all images inside a folder
- alt tag is the ‘caption’
- right click inspect

* pwd tells you where you are
* ls lists the files in that directory
* touch opens the file
* mkdir makes a directory
* cd gets you into the file
* cd .. gets you out one level
