# The Coder's Computer

## Read the article
It's hard when you are a beginner to know what you need and be able to decide. I don't know yet what features will be useful and I don't know how to code well enough to be able to test it yet. I found the piece about code completion to be interesting - it looks like most of the editors have this feature.

### My list
* Notepad ++, *maybe I'll add this one to my work computer (Windows)*
* ~Text Wrangler~ BB edit
* Visual Studio Code
* Sublime Text, *perhaps I''ll shell out the $70 and see where this takes me*
