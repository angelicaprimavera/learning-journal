## Read the article: The coder's computer
It's hard when you are a beginner to know what you need and be able to decide. I don't know yet what features will be useful and I don't know how to code well enough to be able to test it yet. I found the piece about code completion to be interesting - it looks like most of the editors have this feature.

**Visual Studio Code:** This seems to be one of the more popular options. Several of the tech folks that work on my team use it! The benefits of this particular tool are that it's widely available (windows, mac + linux) and has Emmett shorthand for HTML and CSS already built in.

## Terminal Cheat Sheet

### The command line
**ls** = main command. **Note:** Must be space between the command and the first command line argument. **Options:** used to modify behavior of the command

**Commands can**
1. Product an output
1. Perform a task (and doesn't display information unless there was an error)

**Shortcut:** You can do use the &#8593; or &#8595; arrow to scroll through previous commands you’ve entered in the terminal

## Basic navigation

- **pwd**= tells you *where* you are
- **ls** = tells you *what* is there
- **-l** = long listing
- **-** = normal file
- **d** = directory
- **~(tilde)** = home directory
- **Three uses** = home/angelica/documents or ~/documents or ./documents
- **../ ../** = go up in hierarchy
- **cd [location]** = if you run this without an argument it’ll take you back to your home directory vs. with argument to *that* location.
- **tab** = auto completion

## More about files

**Tips**
- Use quotes when there is a space in the name of the file
- **File** = obtains information about what type of file
- **ls -a** = list the contents of a directory (inluding hidden files)
- **Everything is a file!!!**
- Linux is case sensitive
