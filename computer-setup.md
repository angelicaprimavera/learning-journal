It's hard when you are a beginner to know what you need and be able to decide. I don't know yet what features will be useful and I don't know how to code well enough to be able to test it yet. I found the piece about code completion to be interesting - it looks like most of the editors have this feature.

**Visual Studio Code:** This seems to be one of the more popular options. Several of the tech folks that work on my team use it! The benefits of this particular tool are that it's widely available (windows, mac + linux) and has Emmett shorthand for HTML and CSS already built in.
