# The Terminal

## Read the article: The coder's computer
It's hard when you are a beginner to know what you need and be able to decide. I don't know yet what features will be useful and I don't know how to code well enough to be able to test it yet. I found the piece about code completion to be interesting - it looks like most of the editors have this feature.

### My list that I'd like to explore
* Notepad ++, *maybe I'll add this one to my work computer (Windows)*
* ~Text Wrangler~ BB edit
* Visual Studio Code
* Sublime Text, *perhaps I''ll shell out the $70 and see where this takes me*

(*and why itâ€™s important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code*)

There is software that comes with your computer but there are also a number of third party options. 

**1. Visual Studio Code:** This seems to be one of the more popular options. Several of the tech folks that work on my team use it! The benefits of this particular tool are that it's widely available (windows, mac + linux) and has Emmett shorthand for HTML and CSS already built in.

**2. Something else**
