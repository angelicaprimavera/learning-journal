### Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions
== is equal to
!= is not equal to

*The operator will compare two values (numbers, strings, Booleans) to see if they **are** or **are not** the same.*

Programmers can test or check conditions - this is called evaluating.
- Greater than
- Less than
- Greater than or equal to
- Less than or equal to
### Logical Operators
Comparison operators usually return single values of **true** or **false**. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

- && = Logical **and**: If both return as true it will be true, all other outcomes will resort to false
- || = Logical **or**: If both return as false it will be false, all other outcomes will resort to true
- ! = Logical **not**

*Logical expressions are evaluated left to right. If the first condition can provide enough information to get the answer, then there is not need to evaluate a second condition.*

### Loops & Loop Counters

**Loops**

Loops check a condition. It it returns **true**, a code block will run. It runs again/repeats until the condition returns **false**.

- "For" used to run a specific number of times
- "While" used if you do not know how many times, code will continue to loop as lond as the condition runs **true**
- "Do while" same as above but will always run at least once, even if the condition evalutes to false

**Loop Counters**

A **for** loop uses a counter as a condition. This instructs the code to run a specific number of times.

Condition is made up of three statements:

* 'Initialization', set variable to 0
* 'Condition', the loop continues to run until the counter reaches a specific number
* 'Update', every time the loop has run the statements in the curly braces, it adds one to the counter

**Looping**

Looked at this graphic. BUT WHEN WOULD I USE THIS?

### Using while loops
BAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH **mind explodes**
