## Growth Mindset

1. Challenges & Obstacles
  - *These are synonymous to me.* We call this **hitting the wall** at Amazon - it is bigger than your every day task or challenge but the idea everyone hits a wall at some point. You may hit the wall several times. The wall may feel impossible or difficult. You'll want to give up. Eventually, you have to decide to get over the wall. Whatever that means to you. Everyone hits it at a different point in time and no two walls are the same.
2. Effort
  - Maybe I have more of a fixed mindset on this one but in the article, [How you can benefit from a growth mindset] (https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset), **Example #3** is about reaching for the snooze button. I 100% hit the snooze button every morning. Once I'm up I'll put in the effort but getting me out of bed.. ~hell~ heck no. I looooooove to sleep.
3. Criticism
  - This reminds me of when I played sports throughout high school and college (soccer & cheerleading). If my coach wasn't yelling at me, I knew he/she wasn't paying attention to what I was doing. Criticism made me better. 
4. Success of others
  - This also is a sports reference. Whenever someone on the team wasn't performing as well as the others, we considered it a lose for the team. The same was for a win, if one of us was doing really well - the team took that as **team win**.

## Top 3 Reminders about Growth Mindset

1. Hit the snooze button and sleep as much as you need **but** get your ~ass~ butt in gear once you get out of bed!
1. The more you learn here the better you'll be able to support your team. They'll appreciate you for it.
1. Set aside time to practice every day even when something else seems more important. Make this a priority.
