### Discussing what you need to know when creating a website

The first step is to think about who your target audience or company is. Even if you want it to be everyone, chances are not **everyone** will visit it.

You can create customer profiles so that you have a sense of what you're trying to build and if you get stuck you can go back to these questions once you've answered them.

* What would this customer want to see?
* What tasks are they trying to complete?
* Why would people visit the site?
* What are they trying to achieve?
* What information will they need?
* How often they will visit the site?

After defining the above there are a few visuals that can be created to help organize information

1. A site map
1. Wireframes

Below are some things to think about when it comes to how to get your message across in the design.

- Content
- How it is prioritized and organized
- Visual hierarchy, grouping, and similarity

Site navigation is also important. It helps people find where they want to go and there guiding principles to consider:

- **Concise:** Navigation should be quick and easy
- **Clear:** Users should be able to guess what information they will find on a given page
- **Selective:** Primary navigation should be simple and reflect sections/content of the site
- **Content:** Use visual markers
- **Interactive:** Links should be distinct and clickable
- **Consistent:** Self explanatory
